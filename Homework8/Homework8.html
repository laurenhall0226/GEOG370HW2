<h1>Homework 8: Census Ratio </h1>

<h3>For this map, I looked at the highest education levels attained by 18-24 year olds in New York state.  </h3>

<h3>I did this ratio because it is required that people stay in school until a certain age, but I wanted to take a look at which counties have the most people who do not finish high school. This map uses the equal count quantile classifying mode.  The equal count mode can be useful when you want your map to look even and have an equal proportions of data in each class.  However, this can make it hard to visualize outliers, since they are all grouped together with the other data. </h3>

<h3>I did this ratio because I wanted to take a look at which counties have the highest proportion of people who do not go onto college after high school. This map uses the pretty break quantifying mode.  The pretty breaks mode is useful when you want your map legend to look clean and neat.  It goes up by 10s, making it easy to read and understand.  However, it can also be hard to use if your data doesn't split nicely, like when your numbers are much larger and further from a multiple of 10 or 100 or even 1000. </h3>

<h3>I did this ratio because I wanted to take a look at how many people aged 18-24 started college but have not or never did finish it. This map uses the natural breaks quantifying mode.  The natural breaks clssification can be useful when you want your data to be grouped in a way that makes it most similar to the other data in that class.  This makes it the best classification mode for seeing trends on the map.  This mode can be tricky though because the breaks are not always clean numbers, whcih can make the legend hard to read. </h3>
