<h1>Homework 8: Census Ratio </h1>
<h2>Lauren Hall</h2>
<h3>For this map, I looked at how many 18-24 year olds in New York state have earned a Bachelor's Degree because it would be a very low number and I wanted to look at how common it was.  Most of these numbers would have to be from people close to the end of the age range, most likely 22 years old and up.  </h3>

<h3>This map uses the equal count quantile classifying mode.  The equal count mode can be useful when you want your map to look even and have an equal proportions of data in each class.  However, this can make it hard to visualize outliers, since they are all grouped together with the other data. </h3>

<h3>This map uses the pretty break quantifying mode.  The pretty breaks mode is useful when you want your map legend to look clean and neat.  It goes up by 10s, making it easy to read and understand.  However, it can also be hard to use if your data doesn't split nicely, like when your numbers are much larger and further from a multiple of 10 or 100 or even 1000. </h3>

    </a>

<h3>This map uses the natural breaks quantifying mode.  The natural breaks classification can be useful when you want your data to be grouped in a way that makes it most similar to the other data in that class.  This makes it the best classification mode for seeing trends on the map.  This mode can be tricky though because the breaks are not always clean numbers, whcih can make the legend hard to read. </h3>
