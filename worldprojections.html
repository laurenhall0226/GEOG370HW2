    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Lauren Hall</h2>
    <p>First, I uploaded the base layer map into QGIS.  To change the projections, I clicked on the projection number in the bottom right corner and clicked the one I wanted.  To add the Tissot Circles, I used the indicatrix plugin and ran it on my map.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map has Tissot circles that are stretched horizontally at the poles and enlarged, making the coutnries in those areas distorted in size and shape.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map has a more circular layout and the circles are curved the further out you go frmo the origin.  The countries around the edges are very distorted. </h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>These Tissot circles are the same shape so the shape of the countries hasn't been altered, but the circles at the upper and lower latitudes are much larger, indicating that the countries in those areas have increased in size on the map.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This map is looking at the Earth from the North Pole down and aligns the countries in a circle.  Most of the Northern hemisphere countries are not distorted, but the ones in teh Southern Hemisphere are.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkle</h2>
    <h3>The map is rounder instead of having the countries be dislayed perfectly vertical.  The circles at the higher latitudes are closer in size to the equatorial ones, so we can see that the size of each country hasn't been altered extremely, but the shape of the circles at the poles is more oblong, so we know that the countries are distorted in shape.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This map appears to be looking at the Earth from the North Pole and expanding the countries around it. The shapes of the countries are very distorted, as you can see by the Tissot circles, which are extremely oblong and short the furhter you go from the pole.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical</h2>
    <h3>This map was made with the cylindrical method, and it appears to make countries at higher latitudes much wider and larger than they really are.</h3>

    <h2>World Bonne</h2>
    <h3>This map looks like the world is heart-shaped.  It does a good job keeping the countries the right size.  The countries seem to be centered at the equator and the Prime Meridian, and th ecountries further out from that point are very distorted in shape due to the Tissot Circles being stretched and enlarged.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>World Van der Grinten</h2>
    <h3>This map appears to take a combined approach, compromising on both size and shape.  The circles at the higher latitudes are slightly oblong and larger than the ones at the equator, so we know that these countries are going to appear larger than they are, and they are also going to be slightly warped in the shape.</h3>
