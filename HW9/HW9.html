<h1>Homework 9: Choropleth of NCNHP Natural Areas </h1>
<h2>Lauren Hall</h2>
<h3>For this homework, I wanted to take a look at which counties in North Carolina had the most Natural Area acreage.  A Natural Heritage Program Natural Area is a terrestrial or aquatic area that has special biodiversity significance, such as the presence of a rare species, high-quality natural communities, important animal assemblages, or other ecological features, collectively known as “Elements” of biodiversity.  This program is designed to identify these areas and enact measures to protect them.  </h3>

<h3>This map uses the Natural Breaks classifying method.  I used this because I wanted the data to be grouped in similar groups to display the trends best.  I also cleaned up the values to make it slightly easier to read. </h3>
