<h1>Homework 10: Capital Cities Most At Risk Of A Nuclear Meltdown Accident</h1>
<h2>Lauren Hall</h2>
<h3>For this homework, I wanted to take a look at which capital cities in the continental US are most at risk of a nuclear power plant meltdown (Alaska and Hawaii both have no nuclear plants).  The general assumption is that anyone within 50 miles of a nuclear plant is at risk during a meltdown.  I used a radius of 25 miles for each capital city to see where people need to be aware. </h3>

<h3>First I aded a 50 miles buffer to each of the nuclear power plants.  I also added a 25 mile buffer to each capital city, since this is the radius I consider part of a city and its outskirts.  I added an intersection layer showing the overalap between the two, and then I removed the buffer layer around the nuclear plants because it made the map look too busy. </h3>

<h3>In my analysis, I've learned that most state capitals on teh West Coast are safe from a nuclear power plant accident.  In general, there are more nuclear plants on the East Coast, and they are all in closer proximity to major cities, so it makes sense that these capitals on the Eastern Coast will be more at risk.  Baton Rouge, Raleigh, Dover, and Harrisburg are the state capitals with their entire 25 mile radii that are within 50 miles of a nuclear plant.</h3>
