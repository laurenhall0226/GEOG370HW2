<h3>This map depicts how many people over 25 have Bachelor's degrees across New York.  It's obvious that the more populous counties, like New York County, Nassau County, and Suffolk County have many more people living in them and therefore will have more college graduates.  Upstate New York, which is less populous, has fewer college graduates.</h3>
